Abstract—Brain tumor to be effectively treated, it is essential
to identify and diagnose it.Medical image processing has ad-
vanced tremendously in recent years due to machine techniques
for learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep
learning models that have shown remarkable performance in
several health care applications, such as the identification of
brain tumors that are malignant. CNNs are a useful tool for
clinical image analysis because they are capable of extracting
pertinent features from enormous datasets without the necessity
of feature engineering But problems including the absence of
standardized datasets, the requirement for substantial volumes
of annotations, and the comprehensibility of the models con-
tinue to be issues. Despite these difficulties, machine learning
algorithms have tremendous possibilities for healthcare picture
interpretation, and recent developments like explainable artificial
intelligence, federated training, and transferred learning show
promise for overcoming these restrictions. Additionally, new
potential for machine learning algorithms to enhance brain
tumor detection and diagnosis have been created by developments
in imaging technologies including computed tomography (CT),
positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). A patient’s health can be shown in greater
detail by the combination of digital health records and other
sources of healthcare data, which can help healthcare providers
make better treatment decisions. In conclusion, the identification
and evaluation of brain tumors have demonstrated encouraging
results when using machine learning algorithms, notably CNNs.
However, further research is necessary to address the current
challenges and limitations and to fully realize the potential of
this technology in improving patient outcomes.
